Helm charts are structured like this:

mychart/
  Chart.yaml
  values.yaml
  charts/
  templates/
  ...
The templates/ directory is for template files. When Helm evaluates a chart, it will send all of the files in the templates/ directory through the template rendering engine. It then collects the results of those templates and sends them on to Kubernetes.

The values.yaml file is also important to templates. This file contains the default values for a chart. These values may be overridden by users during helm install or helm upgrade.

The Chart.yaml file contains a description of the chart. You can access it from within a template.

The charts/ directory may contain other charts (which we call subcharts). Later in this guide we will see how those work when it comes to template rendering.
